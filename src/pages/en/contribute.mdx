<Rule75by25 title="Community operations">
    The Ubuntu Korea Community runs online forums, chat platforms, and offline events like UbuCon Korea and various seminars and workshops — all organized and operated by volunteers with their own day jobs. If you want to help make Ubuntu events, online spaces, and resources in Korea more vibrant, join as a organizer. Apply through [organizer recruitment posts on the forum](https://discourse.ubuntu-kr.org/tag/%EC%9A%B4%EC%98%81%EC%A7%84%EB%AA%A8%EC%A7%91), [contact the organizers on the forum](https://discourse.ubuntu-kr.org/g/staff), or [email us](mailto:contact@ubuntu-kr.org).

<Rule75by25 title="Support financially">
    Financial support helps community projects run smoothly. To support the Ubuntu Korea Community, [become a dues-paying member via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ubuntu-kr), [purchase swags like T-shirts online](https://marpple.shop/ubuntukr), or buy individual patron tickets when attending events such as UbuCon Korea. To donate directly to the global Ubuntu community, [contribute through Donations Funding](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you#contributions-form).

<Rule75by25 title="Translation and localization">
    Anyone can help improve translations for Ubuntu’s system UI and built-in applications. Join the translation effort so more people can use Ubuntu comfortably. Rather than translating a lot at once, accurate and steady contributions are best.

    - [Translate in Korean](https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu)
    - [Korean Translators team on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-ko)
    - [Korean Translators team Mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/Ubuntu-l10n-ko)

<Rule75by25 title="Bug reporting and QA">
    Like any software, Ubuntu needs careful testing. By running the latest version, reporting issues (bugs), and tracking them until they are fixed, you can contribute to Ubuntu. If you enjoy adventure, the community is always looking for people willing to test upcoming releases.

<Rule75by25 title="Documentation">
    Great software needs great documentation, and Ubuntu is always looking for community members willing to lend their writing skills. Through the [Open Documentation Academy](https://canonical.com/documentation/open-documentation-academy), you can learn how to contribute and work on various technical documents, plus contribute to [community docs on Ubuntu Discourse](https://ubuntu.com/community/docs/contribute/documentation/discourse) and [Ubuntu Korea Community docs](https://discourse.ubuntu-kr.org/c/documentation/45).

</Rule75by25>
<Rule75by25 title="Contribute through design">
    Ubuntu is known for its iconic “circle of friends” logo, distinctive colors, and easily recognizable typeface. Community members who are passionate about art and design have many avenues to showcase their skills. [Learn how to contribute through Ubuntu’s Vanilla web design system, wallpapers, icons, and more.](https://ubuntu.com/community/docs/contribute/art-design)
