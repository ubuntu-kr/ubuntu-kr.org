  # Participate via your preferred chat service
  Our community offers official chat channels on Matrix, Discord, and IRC. Feel free to join with whatever platform you're most comfortable with.

  - Matrix: The primary communication tool officially used by the global Ubuntu community as well as the Korean team.
  - Discord: Increasingly used in various open source and IT communities. Join easily if you're already a Discord user.
  - IRC: The traditional chat method of the Ubuntu community. As we're transitioning to Matrix, using Matrix is recommended.
